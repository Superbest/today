# Description

This is a simple application that copies today's date to the clipboard, in formats such as ISO. Format is specified with command line arguments.

Run without any arguments to see the possible options.

## Why would I want this?

I use [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/), so I put shortcuts (with the command line arguments specified) in a Launchy-cataloged folder so I can easily get the current date for pasting into things.
